      <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 text-justify">
        Unveiling the open secret… The Bhagavad Gita—a book that has been printed in countless editions, read by millions, 
        and is available at the lowest cost in almost every corner of the world. So why does it need to be "unlocked"?
      </p>
  
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mt-4 text-justify">
        While the Gita is widely accessible as a book, its true knowledge remains hidden from most. Lord Krishna himself calls 
        this wisdom <span class="font-semibold text-blue-700">Rāja Guhyam</span>—the King of Secrets. It is an Open Secret—known yet deeply misunderstood.

        Take Dhritarashtra, who heard the Gita from Sanjaya yet remained unchanged. Meanwhile, Arjuna, hearing directly from Krishna, 
        underwent a complete transformation. The difference? It was not just about hearing the words but about receiving them with the right understanding. 
      </p>
  
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mt-4 text-justify">
        The same holds true today. Without knowing how to approach the Gita, it risks becoming just another book on a shelf—read once, 
        then forgotten—its immense power left untapped. In the modern world, the Gita’s teachings are often reduced to managing stress, 
        controlling anger, or improving focus. While these are valuable, they barely scratch the surface of its real purpose.
