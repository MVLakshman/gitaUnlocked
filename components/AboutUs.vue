          Inspired by the profound teachings of Lord Krishna and the incredible transformation it has brought to millions of lives, we created <span class="font-semibold">Gita Unlocked</span>—a platform to make this wisdom accessible to all.

        <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          The <span class="font-semibold">Bhagavad Gita</span>, when approached in the right spirit, has the power to illuminate, transform, and uplift. Great teachers like <span class="font-semibold">Madhvacharya, Ramanujacharya, and A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda</span> have explained its essence over centuries, yet many remain unaware of its deeper significance.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          To bridge this gap, we have designed a structured online course, along with insightful articles, discussions, and resources, to help seekers understand and apply Gita’s teachings in their lives.
